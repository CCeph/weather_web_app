# Weather Web App

A website to check the weather.

## Goals

Get used to using promises or async/await.  
Get used to dealing with APIs.  
Make a sick website.

## Acknowledged Issues with the Project

The API keys are shown to the public. None of the API keys are worth anything, so it is fine.

## Things to Implement

The design of the website.

What happens when a country name is inputted instead of a city name? Eg. Egypt
Add input validation and styling to the client end.
