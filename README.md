# Weather Web App

A website to check the weather.

## Goals

Get used to using promises or async/await.  
Get used to dealing with APIs.  
Make a sick website.

## Acknowledged Issues with the Project

The API keys are shown to the public. None of the API keys are worth anything, so it is fine.

## Things to Implement

What happens when a country name is inputted instead of a city name? Eg. Egypt
Add input validation and styling to the client end.

Style focused autocomplete box.

Style the autocomplete box and selections.

Unfocus the search bar when a location is searched. (Make sure autocomplete doesn't show)

Add frontend validation to forms.

When search query does not result in a city, then handle the error properly.
