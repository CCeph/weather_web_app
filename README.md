# Weather Web App
A website to check the weather.

## Goals
Get used to using promises or async/await.  
Get used to dealing with APIs.  
Make a sick website.  

## Acknowledged Issues with the Project
The API keys are shown to the public. None of the API keys are worth anything, so it is fine.  

## Things to Implement
The design of the website.  
Add ability to take location information from user.  
Hit the weather API.
